# Part 2 Q1

## 1. Markdown Documentation Generator

### ➤ Small Codebase Approach

For small codebases, my first approach would be just using **CursorAI** or **GitHub Copilot**. The reasoning is that they can easily scan/index the entire codebase and generate a Markdown file including all the relevant and important features in a structured manner.

**The prompt would be:**

You are a documentation generator. Given a Python codebase, generate clean, concise Markdown documentation including:
Function names
Parameters (with descriptions)
Returns (with description)
A short explanation

### ➤ Large Codebase / Complex Structure

If the codebase is too large and contains too many files with a complex structure, then we can use a specialized library like **Crawl4AI** because it focuses on extracting clean, structured data in formats like Markdown, which is ideal for LLM consumption.

**OR**

We could use:

- `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) — to parse code and extract function signatures, docstrings, and bodies.  
- `os`, `glob`, or `pathlib` — to recursively traverse Python files.
- Send each function to the LLM and retrieve the Markdown documentation.

**Tools:**

- OpenAI GPT (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-4o)  
- Gemini, Claude, or other LLM APIs  
- Python `requests` or SDKs (e.g., `openai`)

### ➤ For Automation

**Objective:** Iterate over all `.py` files, extract functions, generate docs, and save.

**Integration Plan:**

- Create a CLI or script (`generate_docs.py`)  
- Optional: Use a tool like `click` for command-line UX  
- Optional: Integrate into CI/CD to auto-generate docs on code changes
