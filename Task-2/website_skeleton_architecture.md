1. Multi-Prompt Workflow
The system would operate as a sequential, multi-prompt pipeline. Each stage of the pipeline would use the LLM for a specific task, ensuring a targeted and efficient process.

Initial Summarization: The first prompt would instruct the LLM to read the entire blog article and generate a concise summary. This summary serves as the core context for all subsequent posts, preventing the need to process the entire article multiple times.

Platform-Specific Prompts: After summarization, the system would use a series of dedicated prompts, one for each target social media platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and a general one for Pinterest or TikTok). Each prompt would be carefully crafted to guide the LLM on the specific requirements of that platform.

Twitter: The prompt would instruct the LLM to create a post under 280 characters, using relevant hashtags, and a call-to-action (CTA).

LinkedIn: The prompt would ask for a professional-toned post, highlighting key insights from the article, and encouraging discussion. It would also specify the use of relevant professional hashtags.

Instagram: The prompt would focus on generating a catchy and engaging caption, including a question to encourage interaction and a list of 5-10 relevant hashtags.

Facebook: The prompt would ask for a slightly longer, more conversational post suitable for a community, possibly with a featured question to drive engagement.

Refinement and Tone Adjustment: A final prompt could be used to refine the generated content, asking the LLM to check for consistency in tone, correct any grammatical errors, and ensure the CTAs are clear and effective.

2. Content Adaptation
Content adaptation is crucial for this system. The LLM would be instructed to adapt the tone, length, and style of the content based on the social media platform.

Tone: The LLM would be prompted to shift from a professional tone for LinkedIn to a more casual, engaging tone for Instagram and Facebook.

Length: The model would be constrained to character or word limits, such as the 280-character limit for Twitter, while being allowed more flexibility for LinkedIn and Facebook.

Hashtags: The system would instruct the LLM on the number and type of hashtags to use for each platform, e.g., using a high number of niche hashtags for Instagram versus a few professional ones for LinkedIn.

CTAs: Each prompt would include instructions for generating a specific type of CTA, such as "Read the full article" for LinkedIn or "Comment below with your thoughts" for Instagram.

3. Output Formatting
To ensure the output is structured and easy to use, the LLM would be instructed to generate the final results in a well-defined format, such as JSON or Markdown.

A sample Markdown output for the posts could look like this:

Markdown

This structured output would be generated in a single response from the LLM, making it easy for the end-user to copy and paste the content or for another system to parse and schedule the posts. The use of clear headers and a consistent format would ensure the output is both human-readable and machine-parseable.
